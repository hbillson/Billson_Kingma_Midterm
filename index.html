		<h2>Why Raisins are the Worst</h2>

		<p>Raisins are not a treat and should not be used in desserts! A raisin is a grape that has been dried out either naturally or mechanically. It essentially tastes like very sweet and slightly bitter leather. I personally am not a fan of chewing leather and therefore I don't like raisins. If you have extra grapes leftover that you are unsure what to do with, the answer should always be to make wine with it! I am skeptical of the first weirdo who, after accidentally leaving their grape outside for days, looked at it and said "hey, that looks like a tasty snack."</p>

		<p>When I was a baby, my parents thought that I loved Tim Hortons' Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I would happily take and eat them as most children do, but they had a nasty surprise waiting for them when they decided to clean my car-seat weeks later and discovered that I'd stuffed hundreds of raisins anywhere I could fit them in the seat. Growing up, I was contantly exposed to my least favourite fruit against my will. People even handed out raisin boxes instead of Halloween candy!</p>

		<p>Raisins can be easily mistaken for chocolate chips. This has made baked-good consumption a tense, nerve-wracking experience. You just cannot trust cookies, butter tarts, carrot cake or zuccini loaf anymore. Picking raisins out of the baked good is possible, and often worth the effort depending on the deliciousness of the item, but you can never completely remove every trace of raisin. Raisins make things awkward -- if someone makes their own treat and offers it to you, it's very impolite to mention that you don't like the raisins. You must politely accept the treat and eat it, raisins and all, hoping that the baker can't see the pain in your eyes. You can, however, try to spit out the raisins when they're not looking, and stick them in the nearest inconspicious spot.</p>
